# MerkleHashTree

Merkle Hash Tree implementation using Python 3.9. Code will find the Top Hash of a directory with files containing ".rtf" extensions (which can be removed).

The implementation will require the user to change the variable message with a single file within the chosen directory, as well as path_of_the_directory with the full path of the directory of files to compute top hash for.
